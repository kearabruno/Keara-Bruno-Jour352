        <p><b>Experience</b></p>
        <p>Cashier</p>
        <p>Breakwater Beach Waterpark</p>
        <p>2017-2018</p>
        <p>I worked in the food service area of the waterpark, so I would give out customer's orders to them,
           take around 70 customer's orders per shift and make sure the cooks were making the right food.I gained many people skills and patience with thhis job due to dealing with most of the time, nasty and impatient customers.</p>
                
        <p>Store Girl</p>
        <p>Colonial Bakery</p>
        <p>2019-2020</p>
        <p>At the bakery I took around 200 people's order per shift. We would package the orders ourselves and ring our customer up. I would also re-stock every baked good and refrigerated item in the store every morning. As well as package the online orders when I would go in super early. Through this job I learned a lot more about responsibility, leadership and independence.</p>
                
        <p>Badge Checker</p>
        <p>Holiday City Berkley Pool</p>
        <p>2021</p>
        <p>For this job I had the responsibility to check around 50-70 member's badge to ensure they were a member of the living community and paying for the pool service. We would also clean up all tables and chairs at the end of each shift. From this job I gained more people skills learning about the older members through their life stories.</p>
              
        <p>Hostess</p>
        <p>The Crabs Claw Inn</p>
        <p>2021-present</p>
        <p>I would be in charge of greeting around 200 customers per shift and showing them to their tables. I would also sell merchandise, bus tables, roll silverware and make sure all the server's side work was done at the end of their shift. I would also occasionally check out the servers with our money bank and calculate their tips. Some shifts I would also be the floor manager at night. I would have the resposibility of being in charge of the floor, dealing with any issues of the night, helping out the server's and going up to ever table and checking in on how they were doing. I learned the most things from this job. I have much better communication and people skills as well as independence and responsibility. I also got better at problem-solving due to being the floor manager some shifts.</p>
