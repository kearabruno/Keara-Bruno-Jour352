        <h3>Cashier</h3>
        <h4>Breakwater Beach Waterpark</h4>
        <h5>2017-2018</h5>
I worked in the food service area of the waterpark, so I would give out customer's orders to them, take around 70 customer's orders per shift and make sure the cooks were making the right food.I gained many people skills and patience with this job due to dealing with most of the time, nasty and impatient customers.
